# ── Oracle: reverse‑engineer a rubric from (question, gold_answer) ───────
REVERSE_ENGINEER_RUBRIC_PROMPT = """
You are an expert evaluator and instruction designer.
Given the following Question and a high-quality Gold Answer, your task is to "reverse engineer" the evaluation rubric (Principles) that would guide a model to produce this specific answer.

Question:
{question}

Gold Answer:
{gold_answer}

Please generate a concise, actionable, and specific Rubric (set of Principles) that captures the key requirements, style, and constraints satisfied by the Gold Answer.

Scoring requirements:
1. Each criterion must include an integer `points` in range [-10, 10], excluding 0.
2. Include BOTH positive and negative criteria in the same rubric:
   - positive criteria (points > 0): what should be done
   - negative criteria (points < 0): common mistakes / harmful / missing behaviors to penalize
3. Prefer 6-12 total criteria.
4. `tags` is optional but recommended.

Output Format:
[
    {{
        "criterion": "...",
        "points": 8,
        "tags": ["accuracy", "completeness"]
    }},
    {{
        "criterion": "...",
        "points": -6,
        "tags": ["hallucination", "safety"]
    }}
]

Return JSON array only. Do not include markdown fences.
